## Using Jira API Version 3

To use Jira API version 3, specify the `jiraApiVersion` parameter in the constructor:

```csharp
// Connect to Jira Cloud/Server using API version 3
var jiraService = new JiraService(
    appUrl: "https://your-jira-instance.com",
    serviceUsername: "username",
    servicePassword: "password",
    isCloudVersion: true,
    jiraApiVersion: "3"  // Specify version 3 for enhanced features
);

// Example: Use enhanced project search (requires Jira v3+)
var projects = jiraService.ProjectSearch("MyProject");
```
